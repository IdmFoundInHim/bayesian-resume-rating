# The Bayesian Resume Rating

This project allows you to calculate the Bayesian Resume Ratings for custom game sets. By simply running `python ratings.py`, you can calculate any week of the 2024 FBS season. Other seasons can be obtained from [collegefootballdata.com](https://collegefootballdata.com/), making sure to include all divisions when filtering the data. With some coding, you can use these modules for other sports as well.

As of writing, the website is [still live](http://www.jellyjuke.com/) but ratings will not be maintained in the future by the owner.

This project, unlike the published ratings on jellyjuke.com, rates the FCS teams among themselves and uses those ratings to include FBS v. FCS games.
